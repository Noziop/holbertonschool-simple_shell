C - Simple Shell

This README.md contains the files needed for the Simple Shell. 
This is our third group project, and we will be working in pairs. 
Our team consists of Fassih Belmokthar "Noziop" and Xavier Piedallu "Xa-C24".

For this project, we will adopt the following method to facilitate collaboration:

	_Working on a local branch:
	
	- Each team member will work on their own branch locally. Create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name:

				- git branch Xa
				- git branch fassih
	_

The Simple Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter written entirely in C. 
The program runs based on bash commands obtained from the command line interface (CLI) given by the user. 
Any text seperated by a any number of spaces, tabs or a combination of both is considered to be an argument. 
The respective command typed by the user is then parsed and executed as if in a regular UNIX shell.


	To begin with, we decided to devide the work:

	_Fassy will: .Creat GitHub repository
				 .Creat flowchart
				

	_Xavier	will: .Creat README.md
				  .Creat man page
