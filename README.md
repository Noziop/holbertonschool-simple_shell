C - Simple Shell

This README.md contains the files needed for the Simple Shell. 
This is our third group project, and we will be working in pairs. 
Our team consists of Fassy Belmokthar "Noziop" and Xavier Piedallu "Xa-C24".

The Simple Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter written entirely in C. 
The program runs based on bash commands obtained from the command line interface (CLI) given by the user. 
Any text seperated by a any number of spaces, tabs or a combination of both is considered to be an argument. 
The respective command typed by the user is then parsed and executed as if in a regular UNIX shell.


	To begin with, we decided to devide the work:

	_Fassy	: .Creat GitHub repository.
				

	_Xavier	: .Creat README.md
