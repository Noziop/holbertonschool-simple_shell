.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[\fIoptions\fR]

#include "StarHeader.h"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a simple UNIX command interpreter that mimics the behavior of the standard UNIX shell. It reads commands from the user, parses them, and executes them as if they were entered in a standard shell.

The simple_shell supports the execution of built-in commands as well as external commands found in the system's PATH. It also handles basic error reporting, argument parsing, and process management.

.SH OPTIONS
.B simple_shell
does not have any command-line options. It runs interactively by default, waiting for user input in a loop until the user exits the shell.
